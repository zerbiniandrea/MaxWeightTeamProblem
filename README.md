# KnapSack_tmp
Small Python program to solve a problem where there are n players in a team and we want to get the maximum weight possible for the team, within a given weight threshold.

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach based on the Knapack 0-1 problem:

# Next problem
Starting from this, one could write a solution where the final team has always a fixed amount of members (for example, a team always consists of 6 people).
